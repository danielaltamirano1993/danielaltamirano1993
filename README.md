console.log("What does a back-end developer do?
Back-end developers build, maintain, and debug the back-end that runs an application. As you might imagine, this is a large responsibility that can be broken down into many tasks. Depending on the company, a back-end developer will be responsible for some, most, or all of the following:

Developing the systems and processes to meet the application‚Äôs specified requirements
Maintaining databases, including data storage and retrieval, organization, backups, and security
Finding and fixing bugs in the back-end code
Managing any APIs the company uses to integrate applications, both externally and internally
Conducting performance optimization to increase efficiency and improve the user experience
Creating and maintaining libraries of code that can be reused by developers across the organization
Helping develop the overall architecture of the application‚Äôs back-end
Securing the application from cyberattacks
Back-end developers also collaborate with front-end developers to translate their functions to user-facing content in the app‚Äôs interface. Back-end developers often work with managers, architects, designers, researchers, IT security, and many more to bring web applications to life.");
